# VeluxProject2

The 2nd Technical assesment for Velux.

It is a static website built with vue.js and has desktop and mobile versions.


## Structure

Contains a standard Vue.js project structure, with the following main directories and files:

- `public/`: contains static assets such as images and favicon
- `src/`: contains the main Vue.js source code and subdirectories with components, router, store and views
- `tests/`: contains the unit tests for the Vue.js components
- `node_modules/`: contains the installed dependencies managed by npm
- `package.json`: defines the project's dependencies and scripts

The `src/` directory contains the bulk of the project's code and is organized into subdirectories with components.

The components directory contains reusable Vue.js components used throughout the app.

Overall, the project follows a modular and component-based architecture for easy maintenance and scalability.
